# COnnect4 App

Developer	: Lawrence M. Luna
Email		: lawrenceluna@gmail.com

Description	: This is developed using Ruby on Rails and Javascript which will be deployed at Heroku.
		  As my first ever project using javascript as well as Ruby and/or Rails, it was fun and quite
                  a learning experience.. I've never used a command prompt so much which shows how much a noob I am.

Instructions	: The goal of the game is to connect four tokens of the same color in either vertical, horizontal or 		  		  diagonal direction.
